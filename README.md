# Buffon's Needle Simulation
Simulation of [Buffon's Needle Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem) using the [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)

# Running the simulation
- 'NeedleSimulation' is a function which takes as parameter:
    - The number of 'needles' we want to drop in the current simulation
    - The number of lines (each line will be evenly distributed betwen x = 0 and x = 1)
    - If we want to see the 'needles' being dropped, the third parameter specifies that only the nth needle is drawn on screen
    - A boolean value which indicates if we want to draw the needles

- 'NeedleSimulation' returns the $\pi$ approximation.
